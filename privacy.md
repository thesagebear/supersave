This policy explains how we use any personal information that you provide to us through our website. Please read it carefully. We may change this policy. We will post any changes on this page, so please check back frequently.

For the purposes of data protection law, the controller is Super Save 

We may collect and process the following information about you:

Information we collect about you
When you use our website, we may collect information about your device, including your IP address, information about your visit (including how you got to our websites) and how you use our services. We may combine this information with other information you have provided to us or which we have received from other sources.


We work closely with third parties (for example, business partners, advertising networks, analytics providers and search information providers) and may receive information about you from them. This could include socio-demographic information and information about your likely interests based on your previous web browsing and purchases. We may combine this information with other information you have provided to us or which we collected about you.

How we use your personal information
We use your personal information for the following purposes:

Providing our services to you and fulfilling your requests
Providing you with the information, products and services you request from us 
Allowing you to participate in our interactive features when you choose to do so.
Marketing and advertising
Providing you and others with information about goods and services that we offer that we think may interest you or them, which may be based on inferences and basic profile about your or their likely interests based on your activity on websites operated by  third parties.
Customising or enhancing your experience of our services, which may use inferences about your likely interests based on your activity on websites operated us or third parties.

Protecting our interests and those of third parties and as part of our efforts to keep our services safe and secure.
Managing your preferences (for example, your subscription to our newsletter) and account with us.
Legal basis for processing
Our legal basis for processing your personal information for the purposes described above will typically be one of the following:

Contract
It is necessary for us to process your personal information to perform a contract to which you are a party, or to take steps at your request prior to you entering into a contract.

Consent
You have consented to us using your personal information for this purpose (for example, when you create an account with us, agree to receive marketing emails from us or create an alert). You can withdraw your consent at any time by deleting the information from your account or updating your marketing preferences.

Legitimate interests
It is in our legitimate interests to use your personal information to operate, improve and promote our services (for example, when we customise your experience of our services or use your information for analytics purposes) and to protect our business. Sometimes, we may process your personal information when it is in the legitimate interests of another company, such as another ZPG Company.

Legal obligations
It is necessary for us to use your personal information for us or another ZPG Company to comply with a legal obligation.

Sharing your personal information
We share IT infrastructure with other ZPG Companies, and so we may share your personal information with those ZPG Companies to help store your data efficiently and securely. 

We may also share your personal information with third parties in the following circumstances:

Product suppliers and brokers: to help you find and buy our partners' products and services
We provide your personal information to the brokers and suppliers whose products and services are listed on our website to help you find and buy their products and services. When you buy products or services from these suppliers, their own privacy policies will apply to how they use your personal information. You can find these privacy policies on their websites and you should check that you are happy with them before completing your transaction.


Our service providers: to help us run our business and perform services you request
We may provide your personal information to our business partners, suppliers and subcontractors who provide services to us or where necessary to perform a service that you have requested.

Advertisers and advertising networks: to serve relevant adverts to you and others
We may provide your personal information to our partner advertisers and advertising networks that require that information to select and serve relevant adverts to you and others.

Analytics and search engine providers: to help us improve our services
We may provide information about your visit to analytics and search engine providers to help us improve and optimise our services. We generally only share this information in a form that does not directly identify you.


Storing your personal information
We may transfer, store or process your personal information outside of the European Economic Area ("EEA"). The laws in some countries may not provide as much legal protection for your personal information as in the EEA.

By submitting your personal information, you agree to this transfer, storing or processing. Where we use service providers outside the EEA, we rely on approved data transfer mechanisms (for example, the EU Standard Contractual Clauses) to ensure that your personal information is adequately safeguarded in the recipient country.

Unfortunately, transmission of information over the internet is not completely secure. We will do our best to protect your personal information, but we cannot guarantee its security and any transmission is at your own risk. Once we have received your personal information, we will use strict procedures and security features to try to prevent unauthorised access.

We keep your personal information for as long as is necessary for the purposes for which it is processed. These periods vary depending on the nature of the information and your interactions with us. You can delete the information that money.co.uk holds about you by contacting us using the details below.

Cookies
We use cookies and other similar technologies to distinguish you from other users of our websites and apps (including when you browse third party websites). This helps us to provide you with a good experience when you use our services (for example, to remember your login details and improve our services). We also use cookies and similar technologies to show you more personalised advertising, including Super Save on other websites. You may adjust the settings on your browser to refuse cookies but some of our services may not work if you do so. For detailed information on the cookies we use and why we use them, please read our Cookie Policy.

Opting out of collection of information by third party advertisers
Our third party advertisers and advertising network providers ("Ad Providers") may provide you with ads on our websites and apps or on other websites. To make those ads more relevant and help measure their effectiveness, the Ad Providers may use cookies and similar technologies. They record your activity (including pages visited) and estimate what information interests you most. They use this information in accordance with their own privacy policies. For a link to each of those policies and for information about how to opt out, please read our Cookie Policy.

Your rights
You have the right to ask us not to process your personal information for marketing purposes. You can do this at any time by updating your email preferences by clicking on the "unsubscribe" link in any marketing email we send you or by contacting us using the details below.

Data protection law gives you the right to access your personal information, to object to the use of your personal information for certain purposes, and the right to erase, restrict or receive a machine-readable copy of your personal information. To access, update and delete the personal information we hold about you, please email privacy@money.co.uk or contact us using the address below.

Our websites and apps may contain links to other websites. This privacy policy does not apply to those other websites and we do not accept liability for the content of any other website. Please check the privacy policy of any other website before submitting any personal information to it.
